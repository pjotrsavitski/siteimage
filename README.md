TODO
====

 * Make sure that running multiple PhantomJS instances at the same time is possible without explicitly setting different ports to be used
 * Set better logging with configuration options and possibility to log into files
 * Better handling of errors
 * Need to make sure how does it behave under load (especially how PhantomJS behaves under heavy load)
 * Better documentation
